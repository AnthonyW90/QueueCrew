# QueueCrew - Testing Plan

## 1. Overview

This testing plan outlines the strategy for ensuring the quality and reliability of the QueueCrew. It covers different types of testing, tools to be used, and the overall approach to quality assurance.

## 2. Types of Testing

### 2.1 Unit Testing

- **Framework**: Jest for both frontend and backend
- **Coverage Goal**: Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Individual React components
  - Utility functions
  - API route handlers
  - Database query functions

### 2.2 Integration Testing

- **Framework**: Jest + Supertest for backend, React Testing Library for frontend
- **Focus Areas**:
  - API endpoint interactions
  - Database operations
  - React component interactions
  - State management

### 2.3 End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **Framework**: Cypress
- **Scope**: Critical user flows including:
  - User authentication
  - Group creation and management
  - Game suggestion and voting process
  - Real-time updates

### 2.4 Performance Testing

- **Tools**: Apache JMeter, Lighthouse
- **Areas to Test**:
  - API response times under load
  - Frontend rendering performance
  - Database query performance
  - WebSocket connection handling

### 2.5 Security Testing

- **Tools**: OWASP ZAP, npm audit
- **Focus Areas**:
  - API vulnerabilities
  - Authentication and authorization
  - Dependency vulnerabilities
  - XSS and CSRF protection

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

- **Platform**: GitHub Actions
- **Triggered By**: Every pull request and merge to main branch
- **Steps**:
  1. Lint code (ESLint)
  2. Run unit tests
  3. Run integration tests
  4. Build application
  5. Run E2E tests on built application
  6. Generate and store test reports

## 4. Test Data Management

- Use factories (e.g., Factory Boy) to generate test data
- Maintain a separate test database
- Reset database state before each test run

## 5. Bug Tracking and Reporting

- **Tool**: GitHub Issues
- **Process**:
  1. Discover bug through testing or user report
  2. Create detailed issue with steps to reproduce
  3. Assign priority and tag relevant components
  4. Link to related pull request when fix is implemented

## 6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

- Conduct UAT with a small group of target users
- Gather feedback through surveys and user sessions
- Iterate based on UAT feedback before final release

## 7. Accessibility Testing

- **Tools**: axe-core, WAVE
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Perform manual testing with screen readers

## 8. Cross-browser and Cross-device Testing

- Test on latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- Test on iOS and Android devices
- Use BrowserStack for device/browser combinations not available locally

## 9. Monitoring and Logging in Production

- Implement error tracking and logging (e.g., Sentry)
- Set up performance monitoring (e.g., New Relic)
- Regularly review logs and error reports for potential issues
