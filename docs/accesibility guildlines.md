# QueueCrew - Accessibility Guidelines

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the accessibility guidelines for the QueueCrew, ensuring that the application is usable by people with various disabilities and complies with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## 2. General Principles

- Follow the POUR principles: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust
- Aim for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance as a minimum standard
- Test with actual assistive technologies and users with disabilities

## 3. Visual Design

### 3.1 Color and Contrast
- Maintain a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information
- Provide a high contrast mode option

### 3.2 Typography
- Use a minimum font size of 16px for body text
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Use relative units (em, rem) for font sizes

### 3.3 Layout
- Ensure the layout is responsive and works well at different zoom levels
- Maintain a logical reading order in the DOM

## 4. Navigation and Interaction

### 4.1 Keyboard Accessibility
- Ensure all functionality is operable through keyboard alone
- Provide visible focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Implement logical tab order

### 4.2 Touch Targets
- Make touch targets at least 44x44 pixels for mobile devices
- Provide adequate spacing between interactive elements

### 4.3 Navigation
- Provide multiple ways to find content (e.g., search, site map)
- Use descriptive headings and labels
- Implement skip links to bypass repetitive content

## 5. Content and Semantics

### 5.1 Headings
- Use semantic heading structure (H1-H6) to convey document structure
- Don't skip heading levels

### 5.2 Images and Media
- Provide descriptive alt text for images
- Provide transcripts for audio content and captions for video content
- Ensure media doesn't auto-play

### 5.3 Forms
- Associate labels with form controls
- Provide clear error messages and instructions
- Group related form elements using fieldset and legend

## 6. ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

- Use ARIA landmarks to identify page regions
- Use ARIA labels and descriptions when native HTML is insufficient
- Implement ARIA for custom interactive components (e.g., tooltips, modals)

## 7. Dynamic Content and AJAX

- Announce dynamic content changes to screen readers
- Ensure that all dynamically loaded content is accessible
- Provide loading indicators for asynchronous updates

## 8. Error Handling and Feedback

- Provide clear error messages that suggest how to fix the problem
- Use multiple cues (visual, auditory) for important information or actions
- Provide feedback for all user actions

## 9. Tools and Testing

### 9.1 Automated Testing
- Use tools like axe-core, WAVE, or Lighthouse for automated accessibility checks
- Integrate accessibility checks into the CI/CD pipeline

### 9.2 Manual Testing
- Perform keyboard-only navigation tests
- Test with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver)
- Conduct color contrast checks

### 9.3 User Testing
- Involve users with disabilities in the testing process
- Conduct usability testing with assistive technologies

## 10. Documentation and Training

- Provide accessibility statement on the website
- Document known accessibility issues and workarounds
- Provide training to development team on accessibility best practices

## 11. Ongoing Maintenance

- Regularly audit the application for accessibility
- Address accessibility bugs with the same priority as other bugs
- Stay updated with the latest accessibility guidelines and best practices
