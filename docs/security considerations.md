# QueueCrew - Security Considerations

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the security measures and considerations for the QueueCrew, ensuring the protection of user data and the integrity of the application.

## 2. Authentication and Authorization

### 2.1 User Authentication
- Implement OAuth 2.0 with Discord for secure user authentication
- Use HTTPS for all authentication requests
- Implement proper token handling and storage on the client-side

### 2.2 Authorization
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types (e.g., group admin, regular user)
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for maintaining user sessions
- Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms

## 3. Data Protection

### 3.1 Data in Transit
- Use TLS 1.3 for all client-server communications
- Implement HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

### 3.2 Data at Rest
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database (e.g., using Turso's encryption features)
- Use strong, unique encryption keys for each environment

### 3.3 Data Backup
- Regularly backup data with encryption
- Test data restore procedures periodically

## 4. Input Validation and Sanitization

- Implement server-side input validation for all API endpoints
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement proper encoding for user-generated content displayed in the UI

## 5. API Security

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- Use API keys for external integrations (if applicable)
- Validate and sanitize all API inputs
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage

## 6. Frontend Security

- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Use subresource integrity for external scripts and stylesheets
- Implement protection against clickjacking (X-Frame-Options header)
- Use HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies

## 7. Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Use tools like npm audit to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Implement a process for reviewing and approving dependency updates

## 8. Secure Development Practices

- Follow the OWASP Top 10 guidelines for secure development
- Implement code review processes with a focus on security
- Use static code analysis tools to identify potential security issues
- Conduct regular security training for the development team

## 9. Logging and Monitoring

- Implement secure logging practices (avoid logging sensitive information)
- Set up alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts)
- Regularly review access logs for unusual patterns
- Use a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system for centralized log analysis

## 10. Incident Response Plan

- Develop and maintain an incident response plan
- Define roles and responsibilities for handling security incidents
- Establish a process for disclosing security vulnerabilities to affected parties

## 11. Compliance

- Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)
- Implement necessary features for user data rights (e.g., data export, account deletion)
- Conduct regular privacy impact assessments

## 12. Third-Party Integrations

- Conduct security assessments of third-party services (e.g., Discord API)
- Limit the permissions and scope of third-party integrations to the minimum necessary
- Regularly review and audit third-party access

## 13. Security Testing

- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Perform automated security scans as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Implement bug bounty programs or responsible disclosure policies

## 14. Physical and Environmental Security

- Ensure hosting providers have proper physical security measures
- Implement proper access controls for development and production environments
